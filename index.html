    <h1>Background information  </h1>
    <h2>Like many young men, Christian von Koenigsegg was fascinated by machinery as a boy. He even went so far as to dream about creating his perfect sports car. In stark contrast to the rest of us, however, Christian actually went ahead and turned that dream into reality  at just 22 years of age.With extraordinary determination and vision, Christian explored the limits of both technology and innovation to create the Supercar of his dreams – the Koenigsegg CC. The Koenigsegg CC was the manifestation of a dream and its successful completion gave Christian the courage to continue, and to share his quest for perfection with others. Thus, the car company that bears his name was born.

    <H1>Records broken by koenigsegg </H1>
    <H2>On 28 February 2005, at 12:08 h local time, in Nardò, Italy, the CCR broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest production car in the world, having attained 388.87 km/h (241.63 mph) on the Nardò Ring (a circular track of 7.8 mi (12.6 km) circumference), breaking the record previously held by the McLaren F1. It held the record until September 2005 when the Bugatti Veyron broke the record again by attaining a speed of 408.47 km/h (253.81 mph), proven both by Car and Driver and Top Gear. Both of the records set by Bugatti and McLaren were set on Volkswagen's own test-track Ehra-Lessien, which features a 5.6 miles (9.0 km) straight.
        The Koenigsegg CCXR held the power-to-weight ratio record for production cars at the time of its introduction, with a power-to-weight ratio of 1.3 kg (2.9 lb)/hp. Later the Koenigsegg One:1 held this record, with a power-to-weight ratio of 1 kg (2.2 lb)/hp.
        
        In 2008 the German magazine sport auto conducted a 0–300–0 km/h (0–186–0 mph) test for production cars, with the CCX winning the event in a total time of 29.2 seconds.
        
        In September 2011, the Agera R broke the Guinness World Record for 0–300 km/h with a time of just 14.53 seconds and a 0-300-0 km/h time of 21.19 seconds. Koenigsegg improved this record with the One:1 on 8 June 2015. It attained 0–300 km/h in 11.92 seconds and 0-300-0 km/h in 17.95 seconds (a 3.24 sec improvement over the 2011 Koenigsegg Agera R record), it also attained 0–322 km/h (0–200 mph) in 14.328 seconds and 0-322-0 km/h in 20.71 seconds.

        On 1 October 2017, an Agera RS set an unofficial record for 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) with a time of 36.44 seconds. The record was set at the Vandel Airfield in Denmark and broke the record of 42 seconds set by the Bugatti Chiron a few weeks prior.
        
        On 4 November 2017, an Agera RS set a new record for the world's fastest production car with an average speed of 446.97 km/h (277.73 mph). The record breaking run was done on a closed 11 mi (18 km) section of Nevada State Route 160 in Pahrump, Nevada, United States. On the same day they also beat their own 0–400–0 km/h record they set a few weeks prior (33.29 seconds compared to the old record of 36.44 seconds). It was later confirmed via the instrumentation that the car topped out at 457.94 km/h (284.55 mph)</H2>
